        <p>Hi, everyonne! My name is Akansha Dey. I am a senior studying computer science at Michigan <br>
            State University and I love food. I was born in Kolkata, India and moved to Michigan with my parents <br>
            when I was 11. Although I love our evergreen Michigan, I do miss the bengali streetfood and my <br>
            grandmas special recipies a lot. This website is dedicated to all the foodies out there who moved <br>
            across the world and miss home a little too much sometimes. </p>

        <h2>Biriyani</h2>
        <p><img src="biriyani.png" alt="Biriyani"></p>
        <p>The word Biryani is derived from the Persian word Birian, which means fried before cookingâ€™ and <br>
            Birinj, the Persian word for rice. Many historians believe that biryani originated from Persia <br>
            and was brought to India by the Mughals. Mughal soldiers seemed undernourished and in order to <br>
            provide a balanced diet to the soldiers, chefs were asked to prepare a dish with meat and rice. <br>
            Now Biryani is considered to be a delicacy across the world as royal cooks began to add this <br>
            delicious treat onto their recipe books. The popularity of lamb and chicken biriyani has <br>
            increased and many versions of these dishes have evolved. To prepare chicken biriyani you first <br>
            start off by marinating the chicken in yogurt, garlic paste, garam malasa, salt, chili paste, <br>
            and lemon juice. While the chicken marinates for an hour, you start cooking the basmati rice and<br>
             set it aside once its done. After the chicken is marinated, you cook it separately with fried <br>
             onions and once both items are cooked, you gently layer the chicken and rice and further cook <br>
             the items. Although biriyani is hugely popular across the world and eaten daily in some cultures, <br>
             the dish itself is complicated and takes a level of intricacy.

        <h2>Jalebi</h2>
        <p><img src="jalebi.png" alt="Jalebi"></p>
        <p>Crisp, orange and coiled, jalebi's unique shape has mesmerized us all at some point in life. <br>
            Several poets and writers have used jalebi for a variety of their poetic references and metaphors.<br>
             Jalebi is a popular Indian snack/sweet, that is deep fried and soaked in sugary syrup. <br>
             This dessert can be served warm or cold. They have a somewhat chewy texture with a crystallized sugary <br>
             exterior coating. This exquisite dessert is doled out in the hot oil, using a muslin cloth, fried <br>
             and carefully transferred in the sugar syrup. The process of making jalebi is as intricate and beautiful<br>
             as the final product. This dish is served best as a snack or after a meal as dessert.<br>
             I remember growing up being excited about having guests over because my mom would bring jalebis home<br>
             along with other snacks. You can have jalebis alone, or with a samosa, but best paired with a generous<br>
             dollop of creamy rabdi. Jalebis are also famous in middle east and Africa. In Iran. they are known as <br>
             zoolbia and Azerbaijan as zulbiya. Although the names might be different, the dish still brings joy <br>
            to the faces of everyone who eats them.
